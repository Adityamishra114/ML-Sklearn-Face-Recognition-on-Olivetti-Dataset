# ML-Sklearn-Face-Recognition-on-Olivetti-Dataset
Machine Learning Algorithms: 1. Logistics Regression 2. Support Vector Machine 3. Naive Bayes Classifier Libraries: sklearn, Matplotlib, Pandas, Numpy Olivetti Dataset: The data set contains 10 face images for each subject. The data set has 40 different person-owned, facial images. Size of each image is 64x64. There are 40 distinct subjects, and each has 10 images taken differently. (Hence the data set has 400 rows and pixel size of each image is 64 X 64). Names of 40 people were encoded to an integer from 0 to 39. performing multioutput regression on the Olivetti images and predicting the faces. Best results is on Support Vector Machine (Train-75%: Test-25%), Accuracy 92%.
